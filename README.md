# GDotplotter-A drawing dotplot software for showing genome homology
--------------------------------------------------
We have developed a new program, GDotplotter, to draw genomic dotplots between genomes or within each genome for detecting genomes' structural changes. 

It is composed of several small Perl scripts which can draw different dotplots by various input file format or multiple demands. You can conveniently and freely use them online(http://www.tianyuwuai.com/gdotplotter待定), or download them into your PC and run at command window/shell of Windows/Linux that the Perl and the GD module were installed into your system successfully.

Here, you can easily get all Perl scripts, an example, a help document which help users to use them more efficient. Meanwhile, the source code and binaries of a testing visual program on Windows.
